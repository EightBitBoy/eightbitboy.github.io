Hi!

This first post is a reminder on how to work with Jekyll.

You can `_highlight` text.

You can highlight source code:

{% highlight python %}
# A simple "Hello world!" python program 
x = 100
if x == 100:
    print("Hello world!")
{% endhighlight %}

You can add links to external sites like my [GitHub profile][eightbitboy-home].
